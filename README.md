# vitaprint-gcode-generator

This repository contains g-code generators for Vitaprint 3D bioprinting platform. The current version is built in python and allows building g-code for cuboid and cylindrical scaffolds using either a pneumatic or piston driven extrusion. 

To use the g-code generator, copy the files scaffoldGEN_GUI.py, scaffoldGEN.py, scaffoldGEN_rect.py, schematic.png and schematic_xy.png to the same directory. Execute "scaffoldGEN_GUI.py" by double clicking or via commandline. To function, Python 3 is required with repositories for Numpy and PyQt5.
